This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Then the `electron` was integrated as described in the following repository:
[react-typescript-electron-sample-with-create-react-app-and-electron-builder](https://github.com/yhirose/react-typescript-electron-sample-with-create-react-app-and-electron-builder)

## Available Scripts

### `npm run electron:dev`

Runs the Electron app in the development mode.

The Electron app will reload if you make edits in the `electron` directory.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run electron:build`

Builds the Electron app package for production to the `dist` folder.

Your Electron app is ready to be distributed!
